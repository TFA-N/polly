Polly currently uses several third partie sources and library for which I
would like to thank the authors. Namely that are:

    * Paul Mutton for providing the PircBot API which polly uses to connect
      to IRC servers and for the JMegaHal implementation which is used by
      a polly plugin to generate random sentences when polly gets highlighted.
      URL: http://www.jibble.org
      
    * Hani Suleiman who is the author of JBot, another PircBot based IRC bot.
      I found the sources and decided to use his Classloader implementation 
      for pollys plugin system.

Please note that polly is open source but currently not subject to any
license. You may use and modify all sources that can be found here, as long
as you leave a reference to the originals in the code you use.

Additionally, it would be nice letting me know if you are using any parts of 
polly.
