/**
 * <p>Reader implementations that allows to push back characters into the stream and 
 * provides position tracking. In order to be able to properly track positions of pushed 
 * back characters, this stream distinguishes between normal push backs and artificial 
 * push backs. Also note that this stream uses a FIFO buffer for pushed back
 * characters.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A normal push back may only be used if previously a character has been read from
 * the stream. This may be used to replace the next character with another or to simply
 * push back a character that was read by mistake. The following sample replaces the
 * next character with another one:</p>
 * <pre>
 * void replaceNextWith(PushbackReader reader, int c) {
 *     reader.read();
 *     reader.pushback(c);
 * </pre>
 * <p>The next call to read() yields the pushed back character <code>c</code>. The 
 * position of the stream is not modified, as for each character that was read another 
 * one was pushed back.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Artificial push backs may be used to insert characters that do not occur in the
 * original stream and should thus not modify the position of the stream.</p>
 * <pre>
 * void insert(PushbackReader reader, int c) {
 *     reader.pushbackArtificial(c);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>The next call to read() yields the pushed back character, but as long as no further
 * characters are read from the original stream, this streams position will not change.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>This reader does not support mark()/reset().</p>
