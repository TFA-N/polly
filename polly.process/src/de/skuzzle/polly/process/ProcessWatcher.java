/**
 * A ProcessWatcher waits until a certain process exited and then invokes a callback 
 * method. This allows asynchronous observation of a process created by a 
 * {@link ProcessExecutor}. Use {@link ProcessExecutor#setProcessWatcher(ProcessWatcher)}
 * to assign a watcher to the process being created.
 * 
 * Additionally, a ProcessWatcher can be assigned a timeout in milliseconds. If so, the
 * callback will be invoked if the time runs out or the observed process exited - whatever
 * happened earlier.
 * 
 * Note that observation and timeout check both require separate threads.
 *
