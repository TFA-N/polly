 * {@link Process} class its essential to empty those streams because some native
 * implementations only provide limited buffersizes for these stream. Not clearing them
 * could then lead into a deadlock.
 * 
 * When creating a process using the {@link ProcessExecutor}, you can set an input and
 * an error stream handler using {@link ProcessExecutor#setInputHandler(StreamHandler)}
 * and {@link ProcessExecutor#setErrorHandler(StreamHandler)}.
 * 
 * The StreamHandler starts a new thread which handles the parallel consumption.
