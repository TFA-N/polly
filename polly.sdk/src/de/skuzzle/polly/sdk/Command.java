/**
 * <p>This is the base class for all Commands that can be executed by polly. A command
 * needs to have a name and can have an additional info text which describes how it 
 * is used.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A command has a reference to all of its formal signatures. Add new formal signatures
 * for a command via {@link #createSignature(String, List)} or 
 * {@link #createSignature(String, Types...)}. Upon execution of a command, the actual
 * signature is passed.</p>
 * 
 * This is an example of creating an own command:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyCommand extends Command {
 *     public MyCommand(MyPolly polly) throws DuplicatedSignatureException {
 *         super(polly, "mycmd");    // create command with name 'mycmd'
 *         // Create signature with a short help text, a String and a Number Parameter
 *         this.createSignature("Do something", new StringType(), new NumberType());
 *     }
 *     
 *     <code>@Override</code>
 *     public void executeOnChannel(User executer, String channel, Signature signature) {
 *         if (signature.getId() == 0) {
 *             String string = signature.getStringValue(0);
 *             double number = signature.getNumberValue(1);
 *             
 *             // work with those values
 *         }
 *     }
 *     
 *     <code>@Override</code>
 *     public void executeOnQuery(User executer, Signature signature) {
 *         // do nothing. our command can only be executed in a channel
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Now that you have this command, you need to register it with polly:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Command myCmd = new MyCommand(myPolly);
 * myPolly.commands().registerCommand(myCmd);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Or you may use the {@link PollyPlugin#addCommand(Command)} method to register 
 * commands.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If you want your Command to have the same behavior whether its executed on a channel 
 * or on a query, you may override {@link #executeOnBoth(User, String, Signature)} and
 * make it return <code>false</code>. Note that it returns <code>false</code> by default.
 * That means if you want your command to be only executable on a query, you need to
 * override {@link #executeOnBoth(User, String, Signature)} and make it return 
 * <code>true</code>. Now, both {@link #executeOnChannel(User, String, Signature)} and
 * {@link #executeOnQuery(User, Signature)} are executed, depending on where the 
 * command has been called.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is essential for the usability of polly, that you properly override the method
 * {@link #getHelpText()}.</p>
